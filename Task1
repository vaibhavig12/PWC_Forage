I'm looking to enhance my skills in PowerBI to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards. My goal is to efficiently extract valuable insights from complex datasets, enabling me to make data-driven decisions more effectively. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring automation and machine learning techniques within PowerBI to streamline data analysis processes. By strengthening my design thinking and digital storytelling abilities, I aim to effectively communicate these insights to customers and stakeholders, ensuring they fully grasp the significance of the data presented.
